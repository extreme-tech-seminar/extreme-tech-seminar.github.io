title: Seven More In Seven
---

Our third series of seminars will focus on Bruce A. Tate's
[Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks: Languages That Are Shaping The Future](https://pragprog.com/book/7lang/seven-more-languages-in-seven-weeks).

Through it we will explore seven very different programming languages:

- Factor
- Lua
- Elm
- Elixir
- Julia
- miniKanren
- Idris

We will discover and discuss the various concepts and paradigms each
language takes advantage of, and come to understand what makes each of
them unique and well-suited to different types of work.
