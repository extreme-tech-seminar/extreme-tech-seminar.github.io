title: "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks: Ruby"
author: Correl Roush
---

Our meeting on May 27th will kick off our new series of seminars. We
will start off with an introduction to the new book
[Seven Languages in Seven Weeks]({{ site.baseurl }}/7in7/), then dive
into the first language, **Ruby**.

Meetings will take place every other week at 6PM in the Franklin
training room at CoreDial. Meetings will be led by Kevin or Correl,
but in the true style of seminar we want to make sure everyone has a
chance to contribute, ask questions and drive discussion.
