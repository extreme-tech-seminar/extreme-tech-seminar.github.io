Through our seminars covering _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_ by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman ([SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/)), we will get to know the [LISP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LISP) programming language, and through it we will explore various software development principles and abstraction tools that will prove useful when building any project written in any language.
