title: Seven In Seven

Our second series of seminars will focus on Bruce A. Tate's
[Seven Languages in Seven Weeks: A Pragmatic Guide to Learning Programming Languages](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks).

Through it we will explore seven very different programming languages:

- Ruby
- Io
- Prolog
- Scala
- Erlang
- Clojure
- Haskell

We will discover and discuss the various concepts and paradigms each
language takes advantage of, and come to understand what makes each of
them unique and well-suited to different types of work.
